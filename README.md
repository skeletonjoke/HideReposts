# Hide Reposts on Soundcloud
This is a chrome extention. it does the following:

- hide reposts. BUT only if the song is not from the reposter. This means that if an artist repost his own song that has been posted on another account, you will see it =)
- hide those ugly playlists which contain only one song. 
- There is a checkbox to enable and disable it instantly.

But it doesn't remove the songs from the next playing songs (the thing in the right hand corner)
